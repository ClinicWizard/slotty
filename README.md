# Slotty

Slotty provides a way of determining available slots within a time frame. An example would be where a service provider needs to take bookings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slotty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slotty

## Usage

```ruby
Slotty.get_slots(
  from: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00),
  to: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
  slot_length: 60 * 60,
  timeframe: 15 * 60,
  exclude_times: [
    { start: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 01), end: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 59) },
  ]
)

# => [
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00),
#     time: "08:00 AM"
#   },
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 10, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
#     time: "10:00 AM"
#   },
# ]
```
