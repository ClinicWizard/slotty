# Slotty

Slotty provides a way of determining available slots within a time frame. An example would be where a service provider needs to take bookings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slotty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slotty

## Usage

```ruby
Slotty.get_slots(
  for_range: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00)..Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
  slot_length_mins: 60,
  interval_mins: 15,
  exclude_times: [
    Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00)..Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 10, 00)
  ]
)

# => [
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00),
#     time: "08:00 AM"
#   },
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 10, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 11, 00),
#     time: "10:00 AM"
#   },
# ]
```

If you want to just receive the human times back (i.e. "10:00 AM"), you can pass `as: :to_s` to `#get_slots`

By default, Slotty will return slots that start and end within the given `for_range`. If what you want is to return also the slots that end after the `for_range` range, then what you have to do is to pass `allow_slot_run_over: true`, like:
```ruby
Slotty.get_slots(
  for_range: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00)..Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 00),
  slot_length_mins: 35,
  interval_mins: 35,
  allow_slot_run_over: true
)

# => [
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 00),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 35),
#     time: "08:00 AM"
#   },
#   {
#     start_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 8, 35),
#     end_time: Time.new(2020, 05, 01, 9, 10),
#     time: "10:00 AM"
#   },
# ]
end
```

The `time` returned in the slots is formatted like `%I:%M %p`. If you want to chang the way it is returned, Slotty provides a configuration you can use for that. In an initialiazer do:

```ruby
Slotty.configure do |config|
  config.slot_to_s_format = "%I:%M %P"
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
